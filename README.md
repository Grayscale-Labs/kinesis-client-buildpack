## `kinesis-client-buildpack` for Heroku

This is a [Heroku buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) that
pulls in JAR files used to make use the Amazon [Kinesis Client Library][1].

[1]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-consumers-with-kcl.html
g
It is meant to be used in conjunction with other buildpacks as part of a
[multi-buildpack](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi).

## Usage

Example usage:

    $ heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/apartmentlist/kinesis-client-buildpack.git

    $ cat .buildpacks
    https://github.com/apartmentlist/kinesis-client-buildpack#1.0
    https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby.git#v129


Don't forget to pin buildpack versions you want to use in your .buildpacks file.

## Details

The jar list is the most interesting part of this buildpack.  The list
was generated by creating an empty maven project with a `pom.xml`:

``` xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>com.apartmentlist.kcl</groupId>
  <artifactId>kcl-app</artifactId>
  <packaging>jar</packaging>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <name>kcl-app</name>
  <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
      <artifactId>amazon-kinesis-client</artifactId>
      <version>1.6.2</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</project>

```

Once a new project is created with this file, the dependencies can be
downloaded to a directory.  From the project root, one can simply:

```
mkdir jars
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DoutputDirectory=jars
```

These files can then be processed by `md5sum` to obtain the MD5 hashes.

The group ID, artifact ID and versions for each can be extracted using `mvn`:

```
mvn dependency:list
```

Which can then be split on the `:` delimiter and spliced into the
results of the MD5 output to generate the artifact list used by the
buildpack.
